# Changelog

## Unreleased

### Stability and CI

- Hardened 3D LCFS extraction for coarse smoke meshes:
  - per-ray nearest-boundary fallback when strict crossing is absent
  - conservative ellipse fallback for sparse contours
- Added geometry regression coverage for sparse/non-crossing LCFS rays.
- Fixed CI formatting regression in inverse Jacobian tests (`cargo fmt --check` pass restored).

### Solver Validation and Numerics

- Added kernel-level analytical-vs-finite-difference Jacobian consistency test for inverse reconstruction.
- Upgraded AMR hierarchy and kernel integration to level-aware scaling (`2^level`) for multi-level patch colocation/prolongation.
- Added AMR multilevel tests for hierarchy generation and level-scaled interpolation.
- Added PCE checked APIs:
  - `PCEModel::try_fit(...) -> FusionResult<PCEModel>`
  - `PCEModel::try_predict(...) -> FusionResult<Array1<f64>>`
- Added PCE edge-case tests for non-finite inputs and prediction dimension mismatch.
- Extended pedestal model tests for ELM cooldown gating and minimum profile floor guarantees.

### Release and Metadata

- Added cross-file release metadata consistency test (`tests/test_version_metadata.py`) covering:
  - `pyproject.toml`
  - `setup.py`
  - `CITATION.cff`
  - `src/scpn_fusion/__init__.py`
  - `docs/sphinx/conf.py`
- Removed hardcoded Sphinx release fallback; now resolves dynamically from package source metadata.

### SCPN Controller Artifact

- Centralized artifact schema version as `ARTIFACT_SCHEMA_VERSION` in `scpn/artifact.py`.
- Updated compiler artifact export to use package version for `meta.compiler.version`.
- Added git SHA resolution for artifacts:
  - prefers `SCPN_GIT_SHA`, `GITHUB_SHA`, `CI_COMMIT_SHA`
  - falls back to `git rev-parse --short HEAD`
  - final fallback `0000000`
- Added controller/compiler tests for schema version, package version, and env-driven git SHA stamping.

### Documentation

- Added Sphinx GPU roadmap page (`docs/sphinx/gpu_roadmap.rst`) and linked it in docs navigation.

## 1.0.2 - 2026-02-12

### Solvers and Numerics

- Added analytical Jacobian pathway for inverse reconstruction with selectable `JacobianMode`.
- Added Chebyshev-accelerated SOR and benchmark comparison against fixed SOR.
- Added phase-space memory kernel transport solver.
- Added patch-based AMR baseline:
  - `fusion-math/src/amr.rs` hierarchy and refinement criterion (`|∇²J_phi|`)
  - `fusion-core/src/amr_kernel.rs` AMR-assisted solve wrapper

### Physics and Transport

- Added EPED-like pedestal model (`fusion-core/src/pedestal.rs`):
  - pedestal width scaling: `Δ_ped ~ sqrt(beta_p,ped) * (rho_s / R)`
  - ELM trigger and crash application on edge profiles
- Integrated pedestal model into the transport solver H-mode path.

### Machine Learning and UQ

- Added multi-layer FNO training pipeline and Rust weight loading path.
- Added neural transport surrogate in Rust with `.npz` loading.
- Added neural transport training and validation scripts/docs.
- Added Polynomial Chaos Expansion UQ module in Rust:
  - multivariate Hermite basis generation
  - Latin Hypercube sampling utility
  - fit/predict and first-order Sobol indices

### Engineering and Bindings

- Implemented `fusion-engineering` modules for tritium, blanket, magnets, and layout.
- Expanded PyO3 bindings to expose inverse, transport, and plant APIs.
- Added benchmark suites for inverse Jacobians and neural transport throughput.

### Validation and Documentation

- Added ITER/SPARC regression reference data and validation tests.
- Added GPU acceleration implementation roadmap (`docs/GPU_ACCELERATION_ROADMAP.md`).
- Added this changelog and CFF citation metadata.

### Versioning

- Python package version bumped to `1.0.2` (`pyproject.toml`, `setup.py`, `src/scpn_fusion/__init__.py`).
- `fusion-engineering` crate version bumped to `0.2.0`.
