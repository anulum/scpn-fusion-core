# Future Applications: Beyond Simulation

**Version**: 1.0.0
**Target**: Industry Partners and Research Institutions

---

## 1. AI-Driven Real-Time Control

The FNO-based turbulence suppressor and the neural equilibrium solver developed in this framework are ready for integration into **Tokamak Control Systems**. 
*   **Application**: Real-time disruption prediction and avoidance using low-latency FPGA implementations of our neural kernels.
*   **Goal**: Eliminating "Disruptions"—the single greatest threat to tokamak commercial viability.

## 2. Integration with the SCPN "God Mode"

The Fusion-Core provides the **Material Plane (L1-L2)** foundation for the larger SCPN framework.
*   **Quantum Bridge**: Using the `quantum_bridge.py` module to study the impact of high-energy plasma environments on microtubule coherence in biological systems (e.g., shielding for astronauts).
*   **Lazarus Protocol**: Exploring the use of specific fusion resonance frequencies to drive cellular regeneration through transdimensional coupling (L14-L16).

## 3. Modular Decentralized Fusion

The discovery of the **MVR-0.96** reactor design enables a new paradigm in energy:
*   **Modular Fusion Plants**: Small, 5MW units that can be mass-produced and deployed in micro-grids.
*   **Industrial Process Heat**: Using the 5.3MW output for carbon capture, hydrogen production, or desalination without the need for massive land use.

## 4. Space Propulsion: Fusion-Powered Rockets

The high power-density of compact SCPN reactors makes them ideal candidates for **Direct Fusion Drive (DFD)** propulsion systems.
*   **Efficiency**: Specific impulse ($I_{sp}$) exceeding 10,000 seconds.
*   **Mission Profile**: Enabling 90-day transits to Mars and rapid exploration of the outer solar system.
